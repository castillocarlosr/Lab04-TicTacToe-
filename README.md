# Lab04-TicTacToe-
Code 401 started Jan 11, 2019

## Purpose:
This is a console run app to work on Classes and practice with written code and use xUnit testing methods for Code401 C# .NET class.

##Summary
So this is a tic-tac-toe console game for two players.  

 The code was written with starter code and finished by me.

### How to run the program:
This program requires visual studio 2017.
Run the program to start the console application.
This will be under "Program.cs".

You may look at the source code to ensure nothing evil is in there.

* The console will welcome you to the Tic-Tac-Toe.
* The tic-tac-toe board is generated.
* The console will display the current player for input.  
* The console will warn the player if they try to input the same spot.
* 
* When the game is finished, the console will display the Winner or Tie.

This assignment took about 10 hours to complete.  The hardest part was following the path of the classes with the starter code.


Below are screen shots of what this should look like.
